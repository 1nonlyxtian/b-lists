## What is B-Lists?

The all-new and more simplified B-Lists is a stylesheet that is designed to make beautiful lists easier. B-Lists is both easy-to-learn and easy-to-use.

## Features
* NEW: now can be used with `<ul>` and `<li>`
* hover effects on the left border
* 15 color schemes to choose from
* 3 different list item sizes
* combined with **Roboto**
* lightweight (< 6kb)

### Color Schemes
* Black
* White
* Blue
* Dark-Purple
* Grey
* Indigo
* Orange
* Purple
* Red
* Teal
* Yellow
* Light-Blue
* Green
* Light-Green
* Brown

## How to Use?

* [Download](https://github.com/1nonlyxtian/b-lists/archive/master.zip) a copy of B-Lists
* Link the `b-lists.css` file to your HTML file

Now, let's start *b-listing*!

1. Create a `<ul>` with a class `b-lists` and either `sm`, `md`, or `lg` depending on the sizes. This will be the framework for your list.
2. To do the list items, create an `<li>` with the class of your desired color scheme (ex `red`). The color you picked is the color of the left border of the list item.
3. Repeat Step 1 & 2 until necessary.
4. Close all tags. (Just a reminder :))

There you have it. You now have a list that is more beautiful and more elegant. :)
