## What is B-Lists?

B-Lists is a stylesheet that is designed to make beautiful lists easier. B-Lists is both easy-to-learn and easy-to-use.

## Features
* 20 color schemes to choose from
* 3 different list item sizes
* added custom column grid support
* combined with **Roboto**

## How to Use?

* Download the .zip file of the repository
* Link the `b-lists.css` file to your HTML file

Now, let's start *b-listing*!

3. If you want to have different columns for your lists, create a `<div>` with a class `row` Then, create a `<div>` with a class of either `half`, `third`, `quarter` or `fifth`.
4. Create a `<section>` with a class `b-lists`. This will be the framework for your list. You can integrate headings as titles for your lists.
5. Now, create a `<table>`.
6. To do the list items, create a `<tr>`.  The numbers of rows will be the same as the number of list items. Then, inside the `<tr>`, create a `<td>` with the classes of either `item-sm`, `item-md`, or `item-lg`, and your desired color scheme. The color you picked is the color of the line on the left of the list item.
7. Repeat Step 4 until necessary.
8. Close all tags. (Just a reminder)

There you have it. You now have a list that is more beautiful and more elegant. :)

NOTE: I have added a `test.html` file that you can use as a reference. If you have questions on the usage of B-Lists, you can email me at cfdasalla@outlook.com or message me on Twitter: [@1nOnlyXtian](http://twitter.com/1nonlyxtian).
